# Recycler
A fast pace typing game about recycling for the bevy jam #4

The goal of the game is to get the highest score, when the trash reaches the white line the game is over.
There is a combo system indicated by the blue line at the bottom (Inspired by zType)
You gather combo points by not making a mistake when typing, the more letters in a row you do the more combo points you get.
When the blue line reaches the end of the screen you get a combo increase that will add the amount of combo you have to your score each time you clear a trash item.

If you clean glowing red trash it will explode on impact and destroy nearby trash. 


Pressing ctrl+backspace it will clear the typing buffer.



This game was made by me with the musical help of my amazing partner
